### Other Notes
The `.env` file was not pushed to github, so to successfully get the result we did in the final product, ensure you create your own `.env` file in the root folder of this project and add the corresponding data to the mising fields:
```
VUE_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=______
VUE_APP_PAYSTACK_KEY=______
VUE_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=______
VUE_APP_AUTH0_CLIENTID=______
```

Ensure you also replace all ocurrences of "_xxx_" with the right things.

Happy Coding.
