### Other Notes
The `.env` file was not pushed to github, so to successfully get the result we did in the final product, ensure you create your own `.env` file in the root folder of this project and add the following:
```
VUE_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 'xxx`
VUE_APP_PAYSTACK_KEY = 'xxx'
```

Ensure you also replace all ocurrences of "_xxx_" with the right things.

Happy Coding.
